\opening{Dear Editor,}

On my behalf of my co-authors I am submitting an article titled ``Storm surges in the Strait of Georgia simulated with a regional model" for consideration for publication in Atmosphere-Ocean. This article presents research undertaken by scientists collaborating across Canada to produce a new regional ocean model of the Salish Sea.  We believe that this topic is interesting and relevant to the readership of Atmosphere-Ocean, particularly those readers engaged in regional ocean modelling in Canada.

I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience. 

\closing{Sincerely,}
\end{letter}
