Description of contributions made by each author. 

Kate Le Souef
-initial lit review of past tidal models 
-parameterised river input throughout domain
-began setting up Juan de Fuca boundary conditions with monthly climatology 
-began setting up Johnstone Strait boundary with measured tidal data
-gathered measured water level data throughout domain and automatically downloaded latest data
-began tools for comparing measured and modelled water level (time series and harmonics)
-identified storms in water level data for testing model performance

Nancy Soontiens
- developed open boundary conditions for storm surge sea surface height anomaly at western and northern boundaries
- literature review of previous numerical models of the Strait of Georgia, storm surges in general, and storm surge modelling
- wrote the introduction, storm surge hindcasts, and discussion sections and parts of the model configuration and tidal evaluation sections  
- generated all figures and statistics
- coordinated writing and review of manuscript
- designed, ran, and analyzed all storm surge hindcasts
- assisted in setting up tidal forcing at the northern Johnstone Strait boundary
- assisted in tidal tuning and evaluation

Susan Allen
Science: broad conception of the problem, discussions with Nancy on definition of problem
Model: set-up NEMO 3.4 w Doug, made initial configuration choices (T&S, parameters etc), helped define the rivers w Kate, open boundary conditions w Kate and Nancy, spin-up runs w Doug, tuned the tides
Paper: first editor
Supervision: direct for Nancy, Doug, Kate and in-direct for Idalia
