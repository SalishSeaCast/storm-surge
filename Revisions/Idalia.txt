P14 - Because the tides were tuned for a good match in the Strait of
Georgia, the match in the Strait of Juan de Fuca has suffered,
particularly noticeable at the station closest to the open boundary (Port
Renfrew, 1).

P15 - Note that the model will contain tidal energy from shallow water
constituents due nonlinear interactions in the model equations.

P19 - When the northern boundary forcing is exlcuded the surge amplitude
at Campbell River drops by about 10 cm.

P14: I am wondering if the "suffered" part gives a bad impression of the
SJF tides. Maybe something like the match was "compromised" or that there
was a "trade off".
P15: due "to" nonlinear interactions?
P19: excluded typo
