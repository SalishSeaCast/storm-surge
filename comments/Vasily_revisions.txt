I think that the paper is good.
I have just a comment on your terminology of "local" vs "remote" forcing, as
this might come up with some reviewer. You call the SSH anomaly at the mouth of the Juan de Fuca Straight the "remote forcing" and this is totally justified, because most the of the variability of the sea level was generated outside the model domain. However, if you say that all your winds represent "local forcing", someone can argue with that. The wind and atmospheric pressure both contain features that are both local and non-local with the respect to your domain.  If you truly want to separate the "local" vs "non-local" winds, you have to take the large-scale atmospheric pressure, calculate the geostophic winds, and then subtract them from your total wind pattern. The remainder can be called "local" winds. Otherwise, this is the combination of large-scale and small-scale atmospheric patterns. So, this was a confusing part for me. Maybe, you can add some discussion about your local vs non-local terminology to the paper.
